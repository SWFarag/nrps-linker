# NRPS-Linker
is a webdapp dedicated for extracting and analyzing inter-modular linkers (IMLs) within non-ribosomal peptides synthetases (NRPSs) and establishing the first IMLs database, which will be a valuable asset for researchers interested in combinatorial biosynthesis and rational design of novel non ribosomal peptides.
