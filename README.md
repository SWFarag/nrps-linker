# Nrps-Linker
Inter-Modular Linkers extractor within Bacterial Non-Ribosomal Peptide Biosynthetic Pathways

A computational tool dedicated for extracting and analyzing Inter-Modular Linkers (IMLs)
within Non-ribosomal peptides synthetases (NRPSs) and establishing the first IMLs database. We believe our tool will be
a big asset for researchers interested in the field of combinatorial biosynthesis and rational design of novel NRPs.
